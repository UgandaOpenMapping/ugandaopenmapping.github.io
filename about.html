	<h3>About</h3>
	<p>The World Bank is supporting the Government of Uganda to increase resilience against droughts and food insecurity through a Disaster Risk Financing (DRF) program. One goal of this program is to improve access to baseline data and risk related information to quicken the decision making process.</p>
	<p>By creating up-to-date, open and detailed maps, it will be possible to exactly identify areas and households affected, monitor progress and impact of public work projects, and enable communities to understand their surrounding environment for improved decision making and increased resilience.</p>
	<p>Through OpenDRI projects, open and collaborative data collection is a core part of this approach, heavily leveraging the OpenStreetMap (OSM) open data platform.</p>
