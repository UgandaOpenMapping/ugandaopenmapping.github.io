	<h3>About</h3>
	<p>Information management has been proven a key element to strengthen resilience and improve coping strategies in East Africa, and specifically in Uganda. Where information on meteorological patterns, drought, migrations, livestock market prices, destocking opportunities and water resources is timely available to Government, first responders and to persons of concern, gaps are identified and targeted with no duplications of efforts and especially, without leaving any vulnerable group behind.</p>
	<p>Several information systems have been tested in the past years in the context of Northern Uganda: drought early warning systems, satellite-based insurance schemes for pastoralists, food security classification, mobile applications to facilitate destocking during disasters and cash-transfer strategies;
	<p>Open Data-based strategies coupled with the regional and in-country experience of the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT), can operate as enablers of information systems, by bridging existing gaps in terms of capacity, data access and data stovepipes.</p>
