								<h2>Capacity Development</h2>
								<p>Two 2-days training workshops tailored to the specific needs of Government Agencies in terms of OSM, mapping workflows, data collection mobile apps and data models have been successfully held in Kamapala, specifically:
Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) - 29-30 January 2018
Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) - 19th/20th March 2018
Capacity development targeting UBOS needs, including on-site training, advice and support, was carried out in February and March 2018</p>

								<h2>Mapping</h2>
								<p>One of the main goal of the program is to enable the collection and updating - through field and remote mapping - of reference cartographic data as well as disaster risk management information over key priority areas defined of by the Government of Uganda. It has been established to target the Ggaba parish as priority area to be mapped.</p>

								<h2>UAV</h2>
								<p>The use of innovative technology such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and street-level photo mapping has been introduced to to local government staff and community members during the two workshops held in Kampala at UBOS and KCCA. This cutting edge technology enables high resolution imagery to be acquired and exploited for detailed OSM mapping. Preparatory actions for UAV surveys , including requesting relevant authorisation and flight planning, are ongoing.</p>
